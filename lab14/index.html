                <p>What debugging tools did you use? How did you use them? </p>
                <p>What we decided to debug for this lab was <a href="lab8/index.html">Lab 8 Anon Functions and Callbacks</a> specifically debugging Task X. The goal of Task X was to print
                    the output of the function. At the time we were unable to find the solution to our problem and our code was not working. We used the console.log() to determine if it was working but it was working. 
                    We realized the function was working we sought out the reason why the output wasn't printing. We used Wes Modes' AI WesBot to help us debug the code. Which led to 
                    the conclusion that the output was not printing as a result of the output not being appended to the div, concatenating erorrs, and syntax errors.
